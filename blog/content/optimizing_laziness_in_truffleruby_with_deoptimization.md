This was published by the Shopify Engineering blog, so I won't duplicate the content but here is a [link!](https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/optimizing-ruby-lazy-initialization-in-truffleruby-with-deoptimization) Corresponding [HN thread](https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/optimizing-ruby-lazy-initialization-in-truffleruby-with-deoptimization)

On the bright side, on my personal site I can give it the bad-joke-title that I originally proposed.
