From late grade nine to early grade twelve, I collected hundreds of individual plants and over a dozen different species. Below a crapton of photos I could find, though right here I'll include a list of plants I have owned.

- Dionaea Muscipula
- Sarracenia purpurea
- Utricularia vulgarius
- Nepenthes ampullaria
- Nepenthes ventrata
- Pinguicula Zerchi x Agnata
- Pinguicula Moraensis
- Pinguicula Vulgaris
- Drosera Capensis alba
- Drosera Capensis red
- Drosera Spatulata
- Drosera Hamiltonii
- Drosera Aliciae
- Drosera Binata
- Drosera Intermedia
- Drosera Indica
- Drosera Tokaensis
- Drosera Natalensis
- Drosera Burmannii red

Everyone asks WHY I have this hobby, and the answer is that when I started high school there was a cute boy who was interested in it and using my highly rational mind, I decided this was the obvious way to impress him. It did not work, but I did end up genuinely loving these babies <3 My first drosera that was gifted to me is named Gordon (rest in peace buddy).

Some interesting facts about these plants!
 - Most of them grow in pure peat moss. Alternative soils / other fertizilers will often kill them. Because of this, I also have to wash the soil before using it.
  - They can also grow in live peat moss. I got live peat moss for my plants at one point and it looked beautiful.
 - Some of these plants (namely pinguicula) require cold stratification, where the seeds are left in the freezer in a humid plastic bag to simulate going through winter.
 - Some of these plants are native to Canada! Others are not and had to be protected in a baggie because my house is too cold :(
 - Some of these plants took months to germinate, making them all the more special <3 <3 <3
 - I often cut the flower stalk before it bloomed, as many plants die after flowering.

Next goal:
 - As soon as I have a more permanent place on residence, I plan on collecting succulents and cacti!
