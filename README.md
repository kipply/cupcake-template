# Cupcake Template

This is CupcakeüßÅ, a mirror of my [personal website](https://carolchen.me/). It contains all the features of that website except the blog! Cupcake is best served as a portfolio or online resume. This project will be actively maintained to be a better codebase, and implement new features. It is also open to any kind of contribution - features, bug fixes, improvements or documentation. 

I'd love to see anything people do with this template so drop an email at `hello@carolchen.me` any time. 

# Getting started 

Run the following to set up the project and install dependencies. 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/kipply/cupcake-template.git && cd cupcake-template
npm install -g node-sass-chokidar 
npm install -g react-run-all 
npm install -g react-scripts 
npm install
``` 

Then to start serving the website;
```
npm start
``` 
This will auto-refresh and build CSS on all changes!

To find all the points in the website where data should be replaced with something specific to you, search the project for üßÅ. Sometimes the üßÅ is accompanied by `{{}}` and some kind of description. 


# Deployment
The general deployment process usually involves running `npm run build` and 
placing that into a static site generator. To see all the options, check out [Create React App's Guide](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#firebase). I listed some options with pros and cons below, I personally use Firebase. 

### Firebase Hosting
Pros: Deploy logs, UI for rollback, not tied to github commits
Cons: May cost some money


### Github Pages
Pros: Free forever
Cons: Tied to your github commits/pushes


# Customizations

### Adding Routes
The template ships by default with `/` pointing to `index.html` and that is also be configured and reflected in Firebase. If additional pages are desired there are a few options. 

1. *For all deployment paths.* Using [React Routes](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start), which should be intuitive and easy and work well with the project structure. 

2. *For Firebase Deploy.* Using additional files in `public/`. This is better for any raw HTML files or PDFs. If you added `Resume.pdf` to `public/`, then `yourwebsite.com/Resume.pdf` will work. If you want `/resume` to be a valid path, add the following to the `firebase.json` under `"rewrites"`. 
```json
{
    "source": "/resume",
    "destination": "/Resume.pdf"
},
``` 

3. *For other static hosting.* Adding additional files in `public/` will generally work. 


### Analytics
An analytics service such as Google Analytics will give you a script that should be added to `public/index.html` in the `footer` element. 

### Favicon
The favicon is the little icon that'll appear in the browser tab. It is defaulted to a sparkly heart, though can be changed by replacing `public/favicon.ico`.
